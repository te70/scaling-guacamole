# Prosper loan data exploration

- The prosper loan dataset is a financial dataset. Prosper is an American company that offers loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. The dataset is comprised of 81 variables and contains 113937 entries
- The exploration file has 4 sections: Preliminary wrangling, univariate exploration, bivariate exploration and multivariate exploration
- My conclusions were:
- For the completed loans it seems that estimated returns increase as borrower rate increases while for the defaulted loans it seems that estimated returns increase with increased borrower rate increase
- Another trend we can observe is that, People who work full time have the highest estimated return despite having the worst prosper rating
- Retired people have the least amount of people taking loans but they have the highest estimated return and have the worst prosper rating 
- Retired people have the highest return in the AA rating while the people who are not employed have the highest return in the A category
- In the B category people who are not employed also have the highest estimated return, while people who work full time have the highest return in the C category
